  # How GAN works

  1. Latent space (array of random values) into Generator
  2. Generator makes fake images
  3. label fake images as 0 and real images as 1
  4. Goal of generator = deceive discriminator by making better fake images that looks like real(i.e. discriminator output for fake image = 1)
  
     Goal of discriminator = discriminate all images correctly
